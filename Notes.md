The Google Colab VM has in mid January been updated to Ubuntu 20.04 and runs now Python 3.8 and enables us to use the latest version of the key package PyFMI.  This is all good news! The software has been updated accordingly.

**2023-01-16**
The Google Colab VM updated from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Python 3.7 default) to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Python 3.8 default). 
This means updates are needed in the different repositories concerning scripts and re-compilation of FMUs to function.
