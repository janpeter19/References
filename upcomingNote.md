Here is a new repository including control design of fedbatch cultivation, made on request.
The example is about feed rate control of yeast cultivation during fedbatch with focus on 
how to address variations in the exponential growth rate. The analysis and the design is applicable
to control of other variablies during fedbatch, like dissolved oxygen, pH etc. 

* An example of fedbatch cultivation of yeast with control of the ethanol concentration - see repository BPL\_YEAST\_Fedbatch\_control
