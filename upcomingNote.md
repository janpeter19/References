**Note 2024-03-19**
The BPL is updated to 3.1.2. The names of initial values are changed to using the suffix "start" to comply with the Modelica Standard Library practice. Some other parameter names are also modified. Therefore FMUs are recompiled, Python setup files are updated, and also notebooks. Due to changes in the Google Colab framework, printed notebooks get truncated and for the time being just accept that. See Stackoverflow post.

The conference paper "Design ideas behind Bioprocess Library for Modelica" by myself, and presented at the 15th International Modelica Conference in 2023, you can now find in the proceeding  [here](https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/modelica/issue/view/83) on page 453-462.
