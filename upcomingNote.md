**Note 2024-07-20**

The GUI for BPL has now reached an important milestone and all applications can be GUI-configured and the notebooks include corresponding process diagram. The models and results are the same, of course. Recent GUI work:

* An example of fedbatch cultivation of yeast with control of dissolved oxygen - see repository BPL\_YEAST\_AIR\_Fedbatch

* An example pf ion exchange chromotagraphy - see repositories BPL\_IEC\_validation (but BPL\_IEC\_operation needs a fix around scale_volume, scaling of the time axis).

OpenModelica 1.23.1 was used. In the fall a subset of GUI for the liquid phase only was validated with Impact 2.1 

The issue #12561 with the OpenModelica FMUs still remains.

**Note 2023-10-04**

The BPL ver 2.1.1 with GUI-configured applications with only liquidphase passed validation successfully with Modelon Impact Cloud ver 2.9.25 for Windows.
