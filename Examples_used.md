# Examples used

Here a brief guide to the many examples. There is about one example per repository for simplicity. 

We start with the text book model of a culture with only states for: substrate, biomass, and reactor volume. 
This model is used in many text books and even used for mammalian cultures to explain the main ideas around 
continuous and perfusion cultivation.

* [BPL_TEST2_Chemostat](https://github.com/janpeter19/BPL_TEST2_Chemostat) - Continuous cultivation
* [BPL_TEST2_Perfusion](https://github.com/janpeter19/BPL_TEST2_Perfusion) - Perfusion cultivation

Model calibration is important in practice and a basic example using Pythnon scipy optimization routine is given below. A similar structure of the notebook is found in other "calibration-notebooks".

Design space calculation is an important kind of application and basic examples are given below. Here noise is added to the measurement signal in one of the examples.
